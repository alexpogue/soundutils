CS229 file format

The .cs229 sound format is a plain text file (probably the only sound format 
ever to use plain text). Be sure that you can handle text files created both 
in UNIX and in DOS. The intention of the format is to be flexible enough to be
easy to use, yet rigid enough to be easy for your programs to read. For the most
part, the file consists of keywords and values, both of which are guaranteed to
be "contiguous" text. Keywords may be upper, lower, or mixed case. A file is 
structured as follows:

CS229
<header>
StartData
<samples>
<EOF>

where "CS229" and "StartData" are keywords, and "<EOF>" means "end of file". 
Note that the keyword "CS229" appears at the very beginning of the file. The 
"<header>" section consists of zero or more lines formatted in one of these 
three ways.

  1. Blank (should be ignored)
  2. Starting with "#" (should be ignored)
  3. "keyword (whitespace) (value)" where (whitespace) refers to any number of
     tabs and spaces, and (value) refers to an integer. Legal keywords are: 
     SampleRate, Samples, Channels, BitRes.

The "<samples>" section consists of a line for each sample, where each sample 
is of the form "(value)1 (whitespace) (value)2 ... (value)c"

  * The sample rate (SampleRate), number of channels (Channels), and bit depth
    (BitRes) must be specified. The number of samples (Samples) is optional.
  * The values specified for each sample are signed integers and are in the 
    appropriate range for the bit depth. For example, if the bit depth is 8, 
    then the legal range for all sample data is from -127 to 127.
  * If the number of samples is specified, then there must be exactly that much
    sample data in the file.

The file shown in Figure 3 is an example of a legal .cs229 file.
